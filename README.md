The Thyroid Cancer Risk Dataset from Kaggle, comprehensive clinical data on patients diagnosed with early thyroid cancer, has been selected for analysis. This dataset is containing 17 columns and 212,691 entries, and includes critical attributes such as Age, Gender, TSH Level, T3 Level, T4 Level, and Nodule Size. Such detailed information facilitates an in-depth analysis of factors that may influence thyroid cancer recurrence.

The objective is to create a predictive model that classifies patients into different risk categories for thyroid cancer progression based on detailed initial diagnoses. This model is designed to identify early indicators of thyroid cancer, facilitating the choice of optimal treatment strategies and minimizing associated risks.
